## Context:
### Version 1.0
<!-- wins, challenges, time spent, etc -->
- Ongoing group project begun in the 8th week of contributors learning JavaScript
- Approximately 20 hours to complete test suite and functionality
- Goals:
  ```
  - Perform data manipulation with prototype methods
  - Create navigable and easy to follow user interface
  - Use SRP code that strives for purity
  - Implement robust testing suite using TDD
  - Retrieve data with network requests
  ```
- Wins:
  ```
  - TDD approach taken to writing robust tests, driving code-writing that meets user-story-guided benchmarks
  - Making network requests to multiple datasets, processing data with promise chaining and Promise.all()
  - Working with webpack to execute cross-file imports/exports
  - Integration of graphs on DOM
  - Use of GitHub project board to organize tasks and communicate asynchronously amongst team members
  - Utilizing PR templates to streamline group workflow
  - Quickly and collaboratively establishing a comfortable, safe, and productive team atmosphere with new teammates
  ```
- Challenges:
  ```
  - Working across four time-zones, and collaborators each having rigorous classroom schedules
  - Working with webpack for the first time, understanding its import/export workflow
  - API fetch calls, asynchronous function calls, and using Promise.all()
  ```

### Version 2.0
<!-- wins, challenges, time spent, etc -->
- Second portion of group project begun in the 10th week of contributors learning JavaScript
- Approximately 20 hours to complete added functionality and layout restructuring. 
- Goals:
  ```
  - Utilize POST API to allow users to input and store data
  - Implement tools to improve accessibility throughout the app
  - Incorporate feedback from user testing
  - Implement error handling to improve user experience 
  ```
- Wins:
  ```
  - Achieving score of 100 on lighthouse for accessibility
  - Successfully posting user data to the dashboard
  - Use of chart.js to dynamically plot user data
  ```
- Challenges:
  ```
  - Working with POST API fetch calls
  - Redesigning Version 1.0 user dashboard to include new features
  ```

## Future Improvements:
  ```
  - More testing for DOM-related functions
  - Include more animations, text-effects, etc. to enhance UX
  - Refactor some DOM functions to DRY up code, possibly deferring some functionality to other files
  - Incorporate Sass to clean up CSS
  - Move chart functions to separate file to better organize repository 
  ```
