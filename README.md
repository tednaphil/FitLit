## Installation Instructions:
- Use the green `<> Code` button in the top right corner of the window to access and copy the clone link
- Run `git clone` on your terminal command line followed by the pasted clone link
- `cd` into the cloned directory
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` then paste the server url into your browser. It will appear like the following:
    ```
    Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
    ```
- Use `CTRL + C` to stop running the local server when finished browsing the dashboard

## Context: 
<!-- wins, challenges, time spent, etc -->
- Ongoing group project begun in the 8th week of contributors learning JavaScript
- Approximately 20 hours to complete test suite and functionality
- Goals
  ```
  - perform data manipulation with prototype methods
  - create navigable and easy to follow user interface
  - use SRP code that strives for purity
  - implement robust testing suite using TDD
  - retrieve data with network requests
  ```
- Wins
  ```
  - Solidified TDD workflow, writing robust tests, driving code-writing that meets user-story-guided benchmarks.
  - Making network requests to multiple datasets, processing data with promis chaining and `Promise.all()` calls to enable access to data in our source code.
  - Working with webpack to execute cross-file imports/exports.
  - Implementation of GitHub project board, using “Issues” to organize project work and communicate amongst team members working asynchronously.
  - Utilizing PR templates to streamline group workflow.
  - Quickly and collaboratively establishing a comfortable, safe, and productive team atmosphere with new teammates.

  ```
- Challenges
  ```
  - Working across four time-zones, and collaborators each having rigorous classroom schedules.
  - Working with webpack for the first time, understanding its import/export workflow.
  - API fetch calls, asynchronous function calls, and using `Promise.all()`.

  ```
- Future Improvements
  ```
  - More testing for DOM-related functions.
  - Subtle animations, text-effects, etc. to enhance UX.
  - Flip cards for graph view.
  - Refactor some DOM functions to DRY up code, possibly deferring some functionality to other files.
